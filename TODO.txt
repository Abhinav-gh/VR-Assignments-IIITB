TODO:

Part 1)
a) Used canny edge detection to solve this problem. Detecting the text inside the coins as edge too. so will work on that if possible.
*I should outline only the coins and not the text inside the coins.

b) I have done the coins segmentation using the contour detection. I also implemented the watershed algorithm
to segment the coins. The thing is that i have to tweak around 3-4 parameters for every use case to do it properly. 
* Should look into this and try to generalize if possible.

c) Since i have used contour detection for now, i am simply counting the number of contours that i am detecting and that's the # of coins.

c) Alternate method which i am using is the Hough transform one.
* Again, i have to tweak the parameters for every use case.

Part 2)

Image Stitching:
Finished the image Stitching pipeline. 
- Used SIFT for interest point detection. 
- Used FLANN based matcher for matching the interest points.
- Used RANSAC for finding the homography matrix.
- Used warp perspective to stitch the images together.
- Used weighted averaging to blend the images together. This ensured that the seam is not visible after blending.

Did image stitching for IIITB images. It is working fine but taking almost 8 minutes to complete. 
This is because the blending is taking a lot of computation.
* should look for a way to optimize the blending.
