Part 1)
a) Used canny edge detection to solve this problem. Detecting the text inside the coins as edge too. so will work on that if possible.

b) I have done the coins segmentation using the contour detection for now. I don't understand how else can I do that one for now. I have tried using k means and it's output is comparable but for now, I don't know should I use k means at all or not.
Doubt is whether contour detection method classifies as region based segmentation or not. I should confirm that.

c) Since i have used contour detection for now, i am simply counting the number of contours that i am detecting and that's the # of coins.

c) Alternate method which i am using is the Hough transform one.
