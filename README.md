# üñºÔ∏è Image Stitching & Coin Detection, Segmentation, and Counting

This project implements two major computer vision tasks:

1. **Image Stitching using Feature Matching & Homography**  
   - **SIFT-based feature detection** for identifying key points.  
   - **Homography estimation** to align images into a common coordinate space.  
   - **Gradient blending** for seamless transitions between stitched images.  
   - **Application to high-resolution images**, including real-world datasets.  

2. **Coin Detection, Segmentation, and Counting**  
   - **Preprocessing with edge detection (Canny) and thresholding**.  
   - **Contour-based segmentation** to detect and isolate coins.  
   - **Morphological operations** for noise removal and refinement.  
   - **Counting the number of coins** in an image.  

This project explores how feature-based stitching and image segmentation techniques can be applied to real-world problems effectively.


## üöÄ Features

### üîπ Image Stitching
- Detects keypoints using **SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)**  
- Matches features between images using **FLANN-based matcher**  
- Computes **homography transformation** using **RANSAC**  
- Warps images to a common coordinate space for alignment  
- Uses **gradient blending** for smooth transitions  
- Supports **multiple image stitching** iteratively  

### üîπ Coin Detection & Counting
- Applies **Canny edge detection** and **thresholding** for preprocessing  
- Uses **contour-based segmentation** to detect and isolate coins  
- Employs **morphological operations** for noise removal  
- Counts the number of detected coins accurately  
- Works with **Indian coins** and can be extended to other currencies  


## üìÇ Dataset

This implementation was tested on:
- **High-resolution images** of our institute, captured using a mobile phone  
- **Publicly available images** from the internet for benchmarking  
- **Indian coin images** for the coin detection and counting task  

You can use any set of overlapping images or coin images for testing.
